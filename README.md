# Together Art Academy

Hello and welcome to my latest Website template.
This is my latest design that I have created for art schools and academies. 
This imaginary art academy “Together Art Academy” showcases itself following these goals:

- Presentation and introduction of the academy.
- To attract followers and students who are interested in art and want to learn something, and to maintain an active membership count.
- To let the visitor see and enjoy some of the artworks created there.

## Specifications

This template version works without java script. 
It uses latest HTML-5 and CSS-3 and current web design standards. 
It works on all modern browsers that can handle flex-box and webp image format.
I used mostly Webp image format, because it has a higher compression ratio than Jpeg but is clearly faster than Avif.
This layout design works with a screen width resolution between 360px and 2600px.

## Features

__Navigation Bar__

The compact page navigation bar is always in sight at the top of the page. There is also a Table of content navigation at the top showing the content of the actual page.

__The landing page__

The landing page includes an eye catching photograph with text overlay which should draw the visitors attention and make more appetite to see more. And it makes clear what this site is about.

### Features Left to Implement

- Gallery page
- Signup page

### In future versions:
A burger-menu will be added for smaller screen sizes, so that more menu items can fit in easily.
An always visible table of content could also be added.
Multiple image sizes for landing page image, to make loading faster on mobile computers.

## Testing 

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

I realized that on smartphones when I tab on the services-about-contact buttons, the hover effect remains until I tab again somewhere else, unlike on desktop PCs using a mouse, which was not supposed to be, but this shouldn’t be any serious problem.

## Deployment 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
